RAL RING

2020

Oxidation was a decade-long process on this manhole cover that I discovered on one of my many trips through abandoned houses. The process even ate itself through the 8mm of metal.  
The rust was stopped though with a finisher. I love the contrast beetween the dark oxidation and the bright orange of my favorite color RAL 2005.

Material: oxidized metal plate, spraypaint RAL 2005  
Size: 55x55cm
