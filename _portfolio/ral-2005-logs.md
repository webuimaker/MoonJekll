Ral 2005 Logs  
(powdercoated and oiled wood)  
2020

price on request (please use the mail below;)

Wood cannot be powdercoated – so they say. But Emanuel Mooner proves: you can powdercoat wood.  
Mooner used fresh beech wood, which is not dry yet, so in the process of melting in the powder, the wood logs aren´t burnt.  
Distinctive is the color neon-orange, a reference to ambulances, fire engines, and simply as a signal color for warnings and danger.  
The wood is planed and oiled to resist water and abrasion.
