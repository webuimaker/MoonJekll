BAD BANK  
(powdercoated metal, planed and oiled wood)  
2020

S O L D

Many people have those traditional beertables in the gardens and on their balconies, but they ofen are rotten.  
During the Corona crisis, Emanuel Mooner designed an upcycled version of the traditional bavarian beertable setup that is used in all beergardens.  
He offers his customers to pick up their beertables and bring them back shiny and new.  
Distinctive is the color neon-orange, a reference to ambulances, fire engines, and simply as a signal color for warnings and danger.  
The wood is planed and oiled to resist water and abrasion. The table legs are sandblasted and powdercoated.
